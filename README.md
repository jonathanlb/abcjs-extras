# abcjs-extras
This libary provides manipulations for use in front of [abcjs music notation rendering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulrosen/abcjs).

## Motivation
There are many libraries supporting [abc notation](http://abcnotation.com/), but few support manipulation in the browser independent of server support.
abcjs-extras provides functionality to make simple abc manipulations using only web content, say from files served by a lightweight webserver in absence of an additional network connection.
